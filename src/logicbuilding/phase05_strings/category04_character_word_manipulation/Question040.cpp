/*
* Explanation:
* The value stored in `text` is the input that the conditions or loops work on.
* The `for` loop starts with `int i = 0`, keeps running while `i < text.size()` is true, and updates using `i++`.
* A `StringBuilder` is used so characters or words can be added gradually while building the final string.
* `charAt(i)` lets the code inspect one character at a time by index.
* The print statement shows each value as soon as that value is calculated inside the loop.
